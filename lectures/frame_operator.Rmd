# Frame operator
Frame operator defined as

>$F*v = \sum\nolimits_{k}<v\mid b_k>*b_k$

* The set of $b_k$ may be finite
* Continue list...

Follows from the definition

>$<F*u\mid v> = <u\mid F*v>, u,v\in V$

**Dual frame**

>$b^~ ... $

# Bases and frames

If ${b_k}$ does not span V, there exists a $v\in V$ that is orthogonal to all $b_k$

>$\sum\nolimits_{k} \mid<v\mid b_k>\mid^2 = 0$

# Tight frames

# Matrix formulation

**Frame operator**

>$F = B B^{*}G_0$

# Reconstructing coefficients
>$v = B c$, $B$ is frame, $c$ reconstructing coefficients
